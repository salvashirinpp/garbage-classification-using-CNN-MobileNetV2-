# ♻️ Garbage Classification Using CNN (MobileNetV2)

An end-to-end **Deep Learning project** that classifies garbage images into multiple waste categories using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** based on **MobileNetV2**.  
The project demonstrates the complete workflow from **model training** to **web-based prediction using Flask**.

---

## 📌 Project Summary

Waste management is a major environmental challenge. Manual waste segregation is inefficient and error-prone.  
This project aims to **automatically classify garbage images** into predefined categories using deep learning, enabling smarter recycling and waste management systems.

The solution leverages **transfer learning** with MobileNetV2 to achieve accurate image classification while keeping the model lightweight and efficient.
